# BuffPanel C# SDK

This repository contains an implementation with a simple interface designed to easily communicate with the REST API of the BuffPanel service in your C# Game.

For more information on the BuffPanel service, please visit our [website](http://buffpanel.com/).

## Installation

1.  Download and build the project, which should output the **BuffPanelSDK.dll** library.
2.  In your project right click on **References -> Add Reference... -> Browse ->** select add **BuffPanelSDK.dll**.

You can optionally include the source code files within the 'BuffPanelSDK' directory directly in your project.

## Start tracking

The SDK currently enables you to notify the BuffPanel server that a **player** with the supplied `player_token` (which could for instance her Steam Id or AppleId) has triggered an **event** (for instance the installation of your game).

Upon recieving this event the BuffPanel server identifies your game using a `game_token` (this is a unique identifier for your game generated by the BuffPanel server during the registration process) and internally attempts to attribute the **player** to one of the running **campaigns** for your game.

Include this line of code in the place in your project's code, where your game starts to track the **run event**:

```
BuffPanel.BuffPanel.Track(game_token, player_token, is_existing_player);
```

Where:
- `game_token` is of type `string` containing the game's unique identifier provided by BuffPanel
- `player_token` is of type `string` containing the player's unique identifier
- `is_existing_player` is of type `boolean` containing information whether this player played the game in the past

## How it works?

When called, the SDK sends a HTTP request to the REST API of the BuffPanel server.

### Logging

By default BuffPanel does not log anything. You can turn on logging by specifying logger instance in `Track` call.

```
BuffPanel.BuffPanel.Track(game_token, player_token, is_existing_player, new BuffPanel.Logging.ConsoleLogger());
```

`ConsoleLogger` logs everything to console. You can implement your custom logger by implementing `BuffPanel.Logging.Logger` interface
